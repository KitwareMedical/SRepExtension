# Skeletal Representation Extension
## Description
Skeletal representation has been proved a robust model for shape analysis. This toolkit provides utilities to initialize, refine and visualize skeletal representation model of an object.
It has been incorporated as an extension in [SlicerSALT](http://salt.slicer.org/). More detailed tutorial is under construction.
## Features
This extension has 3 major features at the moment:
1. Fit a skeletal representation to an object. The following screeshots are results from fitting a 5x9 (i.e., the grid of the skeleton) s-rep (shown as the colorful structure) to a hippocampus (shown as the gray triangle mesh).

2. Refinement.
3. Visualize the skeletal representation
